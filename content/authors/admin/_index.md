Hi! I am Luca Borsato, I live in Padova (Italy), and I am an **astronomer** working on **exoplanets**, how to discover and characterise them!
My research interests include exoplanets (Light Curves - LC - , Transit Time Variations - TTV -, and Radial Velocities analysis - RV -), optimisation and Bayesian algorithms, and computer science in general. I am currently involved in the
[CHEOPS](https://cheops.unibe.ch/),
[ARIEL](https://arielmission.space/),
and [PLATO](https://platomission.com/)
missions. You can find more information about my work at [ESPG](http://groups.dfa.unipd.it/ESPG/) webpage!  
I also **like to code**, started with `Fortran`, then moved to `python`,
but now I can write stuff in `Julia`, `R`, `Matlab`, `Go`...
well name it and I'll learn it!  
And I also like video games (quite addicted to Final Fantasy series and RPG), books (mainly like The Lord of the Rings, The Wheel of Time, Terry Pratchett's books, Asimov's books, but also everything else), comics, manga, doing sports (I love snowboarding!) ...even if my back decided to force me to avoid sports :(
